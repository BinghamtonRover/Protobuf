///   manual commands are ignored.

///   sends a command with a [manual_command] payload.

/// for testing and debugging. When a new position override is received, the base station will:
/// - calculate the antenna orientation as if the rover were at this position
/// - send an [AntennaFirmwareCommand] for this position
/// - immediately set the [mode] to [AntennaControlMode.MANUAL_CONTROL] to hold the position
